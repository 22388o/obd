# LightningOnOmni | OmniBOLT Daemon

LightningOnOmni implements the [OmniBOLT](https://github.com/LightningOnOmnilayer/Omni-BOLT-spec) specification, which enables Lightning network to be Omnilayer assets aware. Compile the source code and run the binary executable file, we will have an OmniBOLT deamon(OBD) providing all services for lightning network.   

# Dependency

[Omnicore 0.18](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/tree/develop), which is currently in develop branch, and will be to finalize the release soon. 

Omnicore 0.18 integrates the latest BTC core 0.18, which enables relative time locker used in RSM contracts and HTL contracts.

# Installation
The following instruction works for Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS, golang 1.10 or later.

## step 1: fetch the source code

on your terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/LightningOnOmnilayer/LightningOnOmni.git
```

or if you already set up your local git repo, you just need to fetch the latest version: 

```
$ git pull origin master
```

check if all updated:

```
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/LightningOnOmnilayer/LightningOnOmni.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/LightningOnOmnilayer/LightningOnOmni.git (push)
```

## Step 2: 
### option 1: Remote Omnicore node 
Use our remote OmniCore node. Go to `\config\conf.ini`, you will see:
```
[chainNode]
host=62.234.216.108:18332
user=omniwallet
pass=cB3]iL2@eZ1?cB2?
```
This is a tesing full node for our community to run/call/test omni commands remotely. The OmniBOLT daemon invocates Omni RPC commands from this node, if you use this configuration. It is the most conveniente way to get started.

The other option uses local omnicore full node:  

### option 2: Local Omnicore node 
[Install OmniCore](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore#installation) on your local machine. Omnicore requires a full BTC core node, which may take days to synchronize the whole BTC database to your local device. After finishing synchronization, you can run omni/BTC commands for experiments, such as constructing raw transactions or generating new addresses.

Then edit the configure file: `\config\conf.ini`
```
[chainNode]
host=127.0.0.1:port
user=your user name
pass=your password
```

## Step 3: Compile and Run omni-lightning node
If you fail to install gRPC by `go get google.golang.org/grpc` and other gRPC related packages used in this project,try this:
```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/google.golang.org/
$ cd $GOPATH/src/google.golang.org
$ git clone https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go grpc
$ git clone https://github.com/googleapis/go-genproto genproto
```

During compilation, if you come across:
```
cannot find package "golang.org/x/net/context" in any of:
	/usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/net/context (from $GOROOT)
...
```

That's because these packages had been moved to github. Use the following commands to fix:
```
go to your GOPATH and:
$ cd src
$ mkdir golang.org
$ cd golang.org
$ mkdir x
$ cd x
$ git clone https://github.com/golang/net.git
$ git clone https://github.com/golang/sys.git
$ git clone https://github.com/golang/text.git
```

Wait till all data downloaded.

```
$ go build obdserver.go
```
which generates the executable binary file `obdserver` under the source code directory. 

if you want to generate exe file for windows platform, use this:
```
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build obdserver.go
```
you will see an obdserver.exe file generated under the same directory.

Run:
```
$ ./obdserver
```
The terminal displays:
```
2019/08/23 23:05:15 rpcclient.go:23: &{62.234.216.108:18332 omniwallet cB3]iL2@eZ1?cB2?}
[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
 - using env:	export GIN_MODE=release
 - using code:	gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)

[GIN-debug] GET    /ws                       --> LightningOnOmni/routers.wsClientConnect (3 handlers)
```
Then the daemon is running. We are going to use WebSocket online testing tools to test our lightning commands.


## Step 4: Test channel operations using Websocket testing tool.
Since OmniBOLT deamon(OBD) exposes WebSocket services, we use online WS testing tool to do experiments. Go to:
```
https://www.websocket.org/echo.html
```
Make sure your browser supports WebSocket, as displayed in this screenshot.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot of Websocket online testing site" src="https://github.com/LightningOnOmnilayer/Omni-BOLT-spec/blob/master/imgs/WebSocketTestSite.png">
</p>

Input `ws://127.0.0.1:60020/ws`, press `Connect`. If on the right text pannel, displays `CONNECTED`, then we are ready to send messeages to OBD.

The first message is to get new Omni address for a channel. input the following request into the Message box, and press `SEND`:
```
{"type":1001"data":"email"}
```

In the right side text pannel, displays the response message from OBD:
```
RECEIVED: {"type":1001,"status":true,"sender":"59dfb5e2-f1dc-46c6-8ff3-dfc9f2f1ea82","result":"mzCihFnTFyZUo76QMKovoWWJAPkBqDi63J"}
```

It works.

## Step 5: how to add new service to OBD

TBD

# Current Features

* Generate user OBD(OmniBOLT Daemon) address.  
* Open Poon-Dryja Channel.
* Deposit, close.
* Commitment Transaction within a channel.
