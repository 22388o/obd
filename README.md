# LightningOnOmni 

LightningOnOmni implements the [OmniBOLT](https://github.com/LightningOnOmnilayer/Omni-BOLT-spec) specification, which enables Lightning network to be Omnilayer assets aware. 

# Dependency

[Omnicore 0.18](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/tree/develop), which is currently in develop branch, and will be to finalize the release soon. 

Omnicore 0.18 integrates the latest BTC core 0.18, which enables relative time locker used in RSM contracts and HTL contracts.

# Installation

## step 1 fetch the source code:
on your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/LightningOnOmnilayer/LightningOnOmni.git
```

or if you already set up your local git repo, you just need to fetch the latest version: 

```
git pull origin master
```

## Step 2: 
### option 1: 
[Install OmniCore](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore#installation) on your local machine. Omnicore requires a full BTC core node, which may take days to synchronize the whole BTC database to your local device.
