OBD implements the [OmniBOLT](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec) specification, and it is an open source, off-chain decentralized platform, build upon BTC/OmniLayer network, implements basic multi hop HTLC payment, multi-currency atomic swap, and more off-chain contracts on the network of [smart assets lightning channels](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec/blob/master/OmniBOLT-02-peer-protocol.md#omni-address).

In addition, OBD is designed special for inbound liquidity providers. A daemon allows thousands of remote light clients connections, including connections from [LND wallets](https://omnilaboratory.github.io/obd/#/Architecture?id=lnd-integrated). 

Clone, compile the source code and run the binary executable file, you will have a featured OmniBOLT deamon(OBD) to start the journey of lightning network.     

The latest document/tutorial has been moved to [OmniBOLT - Developers](https://omnilaboratory.github.io/obd/#/OBD-README).  

To know how OBD works, jump to the [OmniBOLT - Architecture](https://omnilaboratory.github.io/obd/#/Architecture).  

The latest features and ETA is here: [OmniBOLT - Features and Roadmap](https://omnilaboratory.github.io/obd/#/features).  

## Quick Start:

#### Graphic Terminal
Graphic terminal is provided by Polar, and is custumized for OBD: [Polar - GUI Terminal](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/polar/releases). 

Polar helps Lightning Network application developers quickly build networks locally on their computers. Here is a short video demo: [https://twitter.com/omni_bolt/status/1549709303921410048?s=20&t=-M9Y4L0Bw_VialiSVPgqmA](https://twitter.com/omni_bolt/status/1549709303921410048?s=20&t=-M9Y4L0Bw_VialiSVPgqmA)  

#### Docker

Docker helps people to quickly interact with OBD and omnicore via their command line tools. OBD uses `docker-compose` to package `obd`, `omnicored`, and `btcd` together to make deploying these daemons easily. Please check the `docker-compose.yml` config file for all the configurations under:

```
https://github.com/omnilaboratory/lnd/tree/obd/docker/obtest
```

We compiled and deployed images for your testing:
```
omnicored: ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/omnicore/omnicored:0.0.1
obd: ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/omnicore/ob-lnd:${lnd-version:-0.0.7
```

[test-shell-template.md](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/lnd/blob/obd/docker/obtest/test-shell-template.md) instructs how to build a network with three nodes(Alice, Bob, Carol), fund each node, build channels, create invoices and pay invoices.  

The testing asset id is `--asset_id = 2147483651`.  

#### Faucet

The faucet we deployed for developers is in this repository: [https://github.com/omnilaboratory/omnicore-faucet-api](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/omnicore-faucet-api) 

** main api**ï¼š 
* mine  
* send_coin  
* get asset balance  
* list assets  
* query asset  
* create asset  

#### Omnicore Proxy
Omnicore Proxy offers public anonymous omni services for obd nodes: [https://github.com/omnilaboratory/btcwallet/tree/publicrpc](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/btcwallet/tree/publicrpc)
