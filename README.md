# LightningOnOmni In-Progress Specifications

Based on the fundamental theory of Lightning network, LightningOnOmni describes how to enable OmniLayer assets to be transferred via ligtning channels, according to the BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) [https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/00-introduction.md] specification, which is a layer-2 protocol for off-chain bitcoin transfer by mutual cooperation.

We name this new specification Omni-BOLT, in order to avoid possible conflicts with BOLT. We destrct our task into two major steps:\\

the first step, we run nodes that are omni assets aware: for example, users can creat channels for USDT, which is issued on Omnilayer and BTC netowrk, then they will be able to transfer USDT more quick and more cheaper.\\

the second step, we will try to be compatible with existing Lightning Nodes around the world, if experts working on BOLT can work together with us.
