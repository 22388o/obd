## Introduction

(latest updated Oct 3, 2020)

The OmniBOLT network leverages lightning technology to provide quick and safety guarantees for anyone who wish to build scalable, decentralized payment apps. We believe that working with skilled security researchers and hackers across the globe plays a crucial role in identifying weaknesses in our network and improving our security posture.

We have created a bug bounty program to allow participants to identify and submit vulnerabilities that could negatively impact OmniBOLT Network users. Successful submissions have a chance of being eligible for a bounty reward. The scope of our program and the bounty levels are provided in more detail below.
