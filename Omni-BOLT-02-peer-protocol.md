# Omni-BOLT #2: Peer Protocol for Channel Management

The peer channel protocol has three phases: establishment, normal operation, and closing.

The basic oprations are the same to [BOLT 02](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md). 


# Channel

## [`Channel ID`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md#definition-of-channel_id)
Some messages use a `channel_id` to identify the channel. It's derived from the funding transaction by combining the funding_txid and the funding_output_index, using big-endian exclusive-OR (i.e. funding_output_index alters the last 2 bytes).

Prior to channel establishment, a temporary_channel_id is used, which is a random nonce.

Note that as duplicate temporary_channel_ids may exist from different peers, APIs which reference channels by their channel id before the funding transaction is created are inherently unsafe. The only protocol-provided identifier for a channel before funding_created has been exchanged is the (source_node_id, destination_node_id, temporary_channel_id) tuple. Note that any such APIs which reference channels by their channel id before the funding transaction is confirmed are also not persistent - until you know the script pubkey corresponding to the funding output nothing prevents duplicative channel ids.
